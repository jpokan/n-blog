# Jpokan (n-blog)

Personal portfolio site and blog using:
- VueJS
- NuxtJS
- GSAP
- TailwindCSS
- Storyblok CMS

After various weeks of learning and trying things, I decided to make this to prove my knowledge while looking for front end development positions (Dec. 2020)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
